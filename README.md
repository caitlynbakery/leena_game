# Leena Game

In this project, I learned how to use bounding detection with CollisionCallbacks and
using sprites from a tilesheet. Leena uses a SpriteAnimationComponent to cycle through
her skating tricks and collects gems along the way.

When we start the game, Leena has full power (30 seconds) which continously decrements as the game updates.

Leena encounters obstacles, such as cute mushrooms, which are a part of the tile map.

The game ends when the power remaining reaches 0. Leena's movement stops!
